# HoneyPot

## Objective

The HoneyPot project aimed to deploy and monitor a T-Pot HoneyPot to capture and analyse real-world cyber threats. The primary focus was to use Elastic Stack (Kibana) for log visualisation and VirusTotal for threat intelligence to identify malicious actors, attack patterns and high risk IPs. This hands on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of: threat detection, incident response and poractive cybersecurity defense through log analysis, network forensics and automated threat intelligence enrichment

### Skills Learned

- Log analysis with ELK Stack - KQL language.
- Improved threat detection and analysis.
- Enhanced knowledge of network forensics.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Strengthened pattern recognition and attack behaviour

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Tpot - multi-honeypot platform using various honeypots to capture attacks.
- ELK Stack - used for log collection, visualisation and analysis of honeypot activity.
- Suricata (IDS) - To detect malicious network activity.
- VirusTotal - To check if an attacker's IP address is flagged as malicious by other vendors
- Firewall monitoring - Protect honeypot, only host IP can connect to main frame, allowed all other IPs to try establish a connection - for log acquisition
